## Social & Humanitarian Innovation Monitoring

`Overview` 🌍🚀  

Monitoring global social and humanitarian innovation at scale requires continuous tracking of UN agencies, international innovation awards, impact funds, and major global media outlets.

When considering the massive volume of distributed content, filtering reliable and relevant information becomes a complex editorial challenge.

This project builds an 🤖 chatbot 🤖 powered pipeline that provides structured access to high-value humanitarian innovation content.

The system automatically monitors RSS feeds, centralizes entries in Google Sheets for manual review, uses AI to rewrite selected articles, automatically selects contextual images, and publishes formatted drafts to WordPress for final editorial validation.

It combines **automation + human editorial control**, ensuring scalability without sacrificing quality.
