Social & Humanitarian Innovation Monitoring
Overview

🌍🚀 Monitoring global social and humanitarian innovation requires continuous tracking of UN agencies, international innovation awards, impact funds, and major global media outlets.

However, the content volume is massive, fragmented, and difficult to curate editorially at scale.

This project builds an 🤖 intelligent automation pipeline that:

Automatically monitors humanitarian innovation RSS feeds

Centralizes content into Google Sheets for human editorial review

Uses AI to rewrite selected articles

Automatically selects contextual images

Publishes formatted drafts to WordPress for final editing

The system combines automation + human editorial control, enabling scalable, high-quality content production.

Core Features

🔎 Automated Monitoring
Aggregates RSS feeds from UN agencies, innovation awards, and international media.

📊 Editorial Control Layer
Structures all entries in Google Sheets for manual validation and strategic selection.

🤖 AI Content Generation
Rewrites selected articles according to defined editorial guidelines (e.g., peaceid.org).

🖼 Automated Image Selection
Integrates with image APIs (e.g., Pexels API) for contextual visual enrichment.

📝 Draft Publishing Engine
Automatically uploads content as WordPress drafts for final human review.
